notes 

10/22
-instead of drawing a new frame each time step,
-at each time step draw every frame that should be drawn up to that time step
-slower and not nearly as efficient, but it'll work and we should start using that and just optimize it later

-also work on audio

from lili:
-find max of x and y axis using the data, because right now it's just a number that you set
